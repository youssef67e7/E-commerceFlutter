# Fixes for Initial Loading Issue

## Problem
The ecommerce app was only displaying products after a manual refresh, not loading them automatically when the app started.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by improper initialization of the ProductsProvider and timing issues with data loading in the HomeContent widget.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. ProductsProvider Improvements
- Removed async calls from the constructor to prevent initialization issues
- Added a new `initializeData()` method that handles proper sequential loading:
  1. First loads categories (faster)
  2. Then loads initial products
- Added checks to prevent duplicate initialization

### 2. HomeContent Widget Fixes
- Added automatic initialization trigger when the widget is first built
- Implemented a check to ensure data is loaded only once
- Used `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback` to ensure the initialization happens after the widget is built

### 3. Data Loading Logic
- Improved error handling in the data loading methods
- Ensured proper state management with loading indicators
- Fixed the refresh logic to properly reset pagination

## How It Works Now
1. When the HomeContent widget is first displayed, it checks if products have been loaded
2. If not, it triggers the `initializeData()` method in ProductsProvider
3. ProductsProvider loads categories first, then products
4. The UI updates automatically as data becomes available
5. Users no longer need to manually refresh to see products

## Files Modified
1. `lib/providers/products_provider.dart` - Core data loading logic
2. `lib/screens/home_content.dart` - UI initialization logic

## Testing
The fixes have been implemented and the app is now running at http://localhost:8000. Products should load automatically when the app starts without requiring a manual refresh.
